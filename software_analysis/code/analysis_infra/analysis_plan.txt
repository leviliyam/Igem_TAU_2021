Analysis of Metagenomes
In this part we will actually use the dataset created to analyze our software
Start the infrastructure, do not run before we agree on the optimization score. (with moran)

Metadata for each iteration for the analysis:
    Runtime (from cluster)
    Number of iterations
    all scores, avg and std of scores
    Optimization score (initial and final)
    Evaluation score (initial = 0 and final)
    Microbiome metadata (what where the wanted and unwanted- size and ids)
    Number of clusters
    Prioritization


Basic iGEM inspired:
    Size: start from a small microbiome, and add to it in each iteration for a couple of randomly selected small groups
    Tuning param for fixed size: create random different groups and examine them against each other, with different tuning param values
    Correlation to 16s (phylogenetic distance) for pairs: like in iGEM

Advanced optimizations:
    Prioritization
    Ratio between wanted and unwanted for different sizes
    Clustering (different thresholds)
    Length of sequence (try genes of different sizes
    Endogenous / non endogenous genes
    Runtime performance: Number of iterations for different sizes ***this is something we should note regardless
