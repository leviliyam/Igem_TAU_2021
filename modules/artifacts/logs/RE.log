2021-10-07 01:42:57,178 - RE - INFO - In this model, the ORF of the gene is analysed and synthetic changes are introduced into it in order to:
     1. optimize translation and ribosome density for all optimized organisms, 
        while deoptimizing it for the other group simultaneously
     2. remove restriction sites recognized by restriction enzymes from the optimized group
     3. insert restriction sites of enzymes present in the deoptimized group
