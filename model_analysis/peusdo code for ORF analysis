### how to divide subgroup?
    make conservation splitting function that accepts:
        1. list of organisms in microbiome
        2. taxonomic conservation level (genus, family, phylum, random)
    the function returns the microbiome split into 2 nearly even, groups.
    however, the specified evolutionary conservation level must remain
    i.e. if genus is selected, bacteria from the same genus must remain together

    lastly, the subgroup should be selected and split 5 times, and the subgroup in which the ratio between
    optimized and deoptimized organisms is closest to 1 is selected.


for x in range(2,20,2):
    select a subgroup of the microbiome of size x
    divide it (in the specified way) to 2- assign which group is optimized and which is deoptimized randomly
    apply model to lux gene (fins flu lux/lax gene)
    calculate Z-score (need to add from noy's model)
    store result

optimally, we would like to repeat this process 5 times for each degree of conservation,
in order to produce the following df:
    columns: run (1 to 5)
    rows: zscore for every x





missions:
1. calculate and store org_dict for all organisms
2. find taxonimic lineage for all organisms from the article csv -DONE
3. create splitting function
